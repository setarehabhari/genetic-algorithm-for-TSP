# genetic-algorithm-for-TSP-
a genetic algorithm designed to solve the TSP problem
In this report i will try optimizing the answer for the traveling salesman problem(TSP) using genetic algorithms.
A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwin's theory of natural evolution.
This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.
Now each genetic algorithm has some important functions which I will explain how they work in my code in this report.
